For Players: pbone Lib is a mod that some other mods need to work. If a mod says it depends on it, then download it.

For Developers: pbone Lib is a library streamlining and abstracting many parts of mod development. It provides facilities for:
- Easily adding Mod.Call messages and mod references - no more giant switch-case statements
- Easily adding new ModPackets - no more giant switch-case statements
- Streamlining the creation and usage of UI
- Many stray methods I've used in mods
